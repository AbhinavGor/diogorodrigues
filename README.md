### Hey, I'm Diogo Rodrigues! ✌

I work as a ~~web designer~~ front-end developer with UI/UX design skills (front-end designer). I´m based in São Paulo, Brazil.

Since 2009 I've been living and breathing web development and creating modern and user friendly interfaces. I've had the chance to immerse myself in many different works and projects, helping to make this world a little better through design & code. ✨😍

> "Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works." - Steve Jobs

I'm always trying to grow and learn something new. I lose track of time when I'm playing the violin, studying languages or simply reading a good book.

### What I'm focusing on 👨‍💻

Currently improving my React skills: NextJS, Gatsby JS and React Native.<br />
BTW, if you´re looking for a Gatsby starter, take a look at this [Gatsby multi-language starter with CMS](https://github.com/diogorodrigues/iceberg-gatsby-multilang).
